    "# Jupyter Code Executor\n",

    "AutoGen is able to execute code in a stateful Jupyter kernel, this is in contrast to the command line code executor where each code block is executed in a new process. This means that you can define variables in one code block and use them in another. One of the interesting properties of this is that when an error is encountered, only the failing code needs to be re-executed, and not the entire script.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the [`JupyterCodeExecutor`](/docs/reference/coding/jupyter/jupyter_code_executor#jupytercodeexecutor) you need a Jupyter server running. This can be in Docker, local, or even a remote server. Then, when constructing the [`JupyterCodeExecutor`](/docs/reference/coding/jupyter/jupyter_code_executor#jupytercodeexecutor) you pass it the server it should connect to.\n",

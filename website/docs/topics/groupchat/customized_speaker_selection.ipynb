    "In GroupChat, we can customize the speaker selection by passing a function to the `GroupChat` object. With this function, you can build a more **deterministic** agent workflow. We recommend following a **StateFlow** pattern when crafting this function. Please refer to the [StateFlow blog](/blog/2024/02/29/StateFlow) for more details.\n",

    "## An example research workflow\n",
    "We provide a simple example to build a StateFlow model for research with customized speaker selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first define the following agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initializer: Start the workflow by sending a task.\n",
    "- Coder: Retrieve papers from the internet by writing code.\n",
    "- Executor: Execute the code.\n",
    "- Scientist: Read the papers and write a summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure above, we define a simple workflow for research with 4 states: *Init*, *Retrieve*, *Research*, and *End*. Within each state, we will call different agents to perform the tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Init*: We use the initializer to start the workflow.\n",
    "- *Retrieve*: We will first call the coder to write code and then call the executor to execute the code.\n",
    "- *Research*: We will call the scientist to read the papers and write a summary.\n",
    "- *End*: We will end the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
